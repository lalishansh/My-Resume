I am writing in response to your posting for a Physics Programmer on LinkedIn.

I am pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science and super passionate about Real-Time Applications, Games. I have a very positive inclination to writing/coding highly scalable programs/codes.

My workstyle is going above and beyond interpreting briefs. I ensure to identify opportunities to innovate and exceed expectations with original designs. Always striving to improve, I have built several projects in C++, Golang, Python etc., Some of them are mentioned in resume and are available on my GitHub. The fantastic world of Real-Time High-Performance Computing and Beautiful World of Games has always fluttered my heart. 

As mentioned in the resume, most of my skills are dedicated towards application's backend side that are scalable and a combination of high-low level programming. My goal is to contribute to further the development of both computer graphics and high-performance computing and be a part of humanities technological advancement.

Please review my attached application for additional details regarding my expertise and achievements.

Thank you for your consideration.
