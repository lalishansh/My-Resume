  - Handling bugs and issues related to building silhouettes and vegetation etc.
  - Building silhouettes and vegetation should be placed on the map in the final build.
  - Major Bugs and issues related to building silhouettes and vegetation should be resolved.
. I'd like provide have the building rendering validated as per Art Direction So that we have final output in the MapBG. Building silhouette is summitted and working in the building, We now want to polish the rendering as per the Art Direction: They are properly placed and stylized as per art direction.
. Roads are missing at max zoom level on the map on PS5. When viewing the map in latest Ps5 builds, increasing to max zoom level will casue the roads to disappear
. Need to have a robust logic to query the loading status of the entities in the Atlas: Loadings of entities should be handled properly and not depends on the FrameWait variable.
. I want to fix the creation of the cached polygon so that it can correctly displayed in the engine mode. Make cached submesh data engine mode only. and ensure the polygons are cached during forge creation
  - Ensure caching happens at forge creation with polygon creation.
  - Ensure the implementation is done and submitted in the game.
. Buildings need to have default material defined: Building should be rendered with a default material for intial submit, which can later be tweaked by daniel according to the art direction.
. Buildings after hovering becoming look faded out: check with daniel and Art director what should happen in such a situation to tweak the material accordingly.
. Tag Rail Depot Buildings so they appear on living map
  - We have various building getting rendered on MapBG, we as well need rail depot to be shown in MapBG.
  - We as well want to fix polish issue on MapBG according to screenshot attach with the task.
  - Buildings are shown in depot and polish issues are tackled.
. Buildings boundaries should not have white line and should resemble the Target Art Direction.
. Boundaries of the sectors are alternatively black and green: Boundaries of the sectors are alternatively black and greenish yellow. This should be fixed to resemble the Target Art Direction.
. Merging of the roads should work fine
. Support for Vegetation Data Provider for MapBackground, Refer [CREST-29894|https://ne1-tomcat-jira153-dc.ubisoft.org/jira/browse/CREST-29894]: Getting/Using associated entity ptr instead of world pointer in GetShapeMeshData
. Quitting while Map is open shows the entire world

. No entities capured when running EntityAtlasGenerator's RegenerateAllAtlases
. Clean-Up Serialization Code from VisualShapeCollectionComponent
. Research for Complete UI rendering and Present it in the knowledge sharing session. Research on how the rendering works for complete UI. Ex. FOG, Trails-Networks, Sectors, Highlights, Alerts etc. Present the findings in the knowledge sharing
  - Research document should be created and shared with the team.
  - Presentation should be done in the knowledge sharing session.
. Currently we render the MapBG at 1080p Resolution, ensure it matches the UI resolution and we have no TextureInfo Loss due to upscaling. Currently the map Background is not scalable *Need more info*: UI Becomes scalable with multiple aspect-ratios/resolutions.
. Refactor outline shader for building silhouttes and related files
. White Dots in outline of building silhouttes: White Dots in outline of building silhouttes
. Support for Forests in MapBackground: Research and figure out the reason of overlapping of boundaries and sector areas in higher state that leads to sector boundary turning greenish and provide a fix for the same.
. Forests in MapBG
. Removing the anti aliasing from MapBG, Currently MapBG looks smudged when player moves cursor which makes it looks blurry.
  - Smudging to be prevented.
  - Devtested and shelved
. I'd like to Provide support and resolve techdebts in the overall MapCore tech so that the feature can be finalized: Provide support and fixed feedback issues on MapBG for LivingMap.
. Update render order of MapBG entities to match Art direction.
. UVs on mesh curves on MapBG (VisualCurveCollectionComponent) are skewed: This a limitation of current system, it uses length of the curve to determine UVs of the curve which results in them becoming skewed on turns.
. I want to profile and resolve the spike in the FPS while opening the map, So that the Map transition is polished, We have observed a FPS spike while opening the Map, It needs to be profiled and fixed: The FPS spike is resolved in the game.
. I want to Research for a solution for Water and out of bounds in order to get them automated, so that we have a clear plan for the same.
. I want to automate water on LivingMap BG, so that we have no blur on the water on the map BG, Automate the water creation on the Living Map BG with a better material as well as the generation should be automated
  - Water is automated and generate as the forest or any other element on the Map BG.
  - The material used for water should respect the Art direction.
. FPS drops below 10 when player is inside the map on all the executables, After following the steps mentioned it is observed that When the player enters the map, the frame rate falls below 10
  - This issue occurs only when player is in the world
  - This issue is occurring on all the executables 
. Circular target screen flashes before map opens: When opening the living map from the hideout a blue screen with white circles will flash on screen before the map opens. 
. Living Map flickers while zooming out when it is accessed from hideout & In-game: After following the above-mentioned steps, it is observed that the living map flickers while zooming out when it is accessed in hideout/In-game.
. Provide the method for rendering Primary and Secondary Roads separately
. Add Placeholder name and Jump camera to location command for the point of interest data: Kenni Hornstrup told me that he was having a hard-time locating where the corresponding entities will go for thumbnails of point of interests. So I'm adding a string label (to act as placeholder) and a Class Command that will jump the camera top-down to that location.
. Added an assert to better suggest the error resolution: Added an assert to fail when mesh triangulation fails (done on world loading). This will better represent than previous OOB error.
. Getting wasted frame-times back in map-mode crest: When Dropping in and in map mode hovering over steelworks, dosen't result in FPS drop. (aka constant frametimes all over map)
. Dead enemy bodies go missing when users zoom in on them using binoculars. When zooming in on dead enemies using the binoculars, their bodies will disappear at certain zoom levels/distances. This seems to occur more when looking at the head/upper torso area: Users must use the binoculars quite close to the body, for issue to occur. Issue does not occur when zooming in from a distance.
. I want to research and experiment with data layers so thatwe can control loading and unloading of entities for atlas generation.
  - Experimentation with data layers is done.
  - Tech design is ready for atlas generation.
. Region lines / boundaries distorted on map - PS5 / PC: In latest builds the region bounderis on the living map are distored and will draw lines across the screen
. Rendering order and disable temporalAA on Map Background Elements: Matching the placement/render-order of map elements acc to art direction and disable TemporalAA on them
. Map icons are offset from the map when player moves the cursor: In latest builds when the player moves the cursor around the map, the icons will then become offset from their inteded location and move a limited amount, when the cursor stops moving the icon will return to its inteded location 
. Tech FSO - Map: We would like to get a Tech FSO outline for Map â€“ more documentation than FSO perhaps according to the new Template
